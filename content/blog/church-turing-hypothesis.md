# Church-Turing Hypothesis

The church turning hypothesis is essentially a hypothesis that answers the question, _"What are algorithms?"_ The hypothesis states that algorithms are nothing but Turing machines. Any mechanical computation can be performed by a Turing machine. If there is no Turing machine that can decide a problem P, then there is no algorithm that can solve P.

Note that while the Church-Turing Hypothesis is just a hypothesis and **not** proof. However, it is widely accepted as it is founded on very logical arguments that are based on the "axioms" of computing we stated while defining what constitutes a computational solution.

## The Turing Machine

We have an infinite length tape that has been split into an infinite number of finite length cells. We have a "read/write" head that can move along the tape (to the left or right cells). This read-write head operates on the current cell it is on top of. Note that this is in line with the fact that it is not possible to read/write to an infinite amount of memory. Hence it must operate on finite-sized cells.

The Turing machine is defined as a 7-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{accept}, q_{reject})$.

1. $Q$ - **The finite set of states**
    
    The TM must at all times be in one of the finitely many _control_ states defined by the set $Q$. This is similar to the state diagram of circuits. When in a particular state the TM decides and responds to some input based on the control state it is in.
    
2. $\Sigma$ - **The finite alphabet set (not containing blank)**
    
    $\Sigma$ is the finite input alphabet. This is the _alphabet_ we encode our input in. Since input can be of any size, we also require a _blank_ alphabet to represent the end of some particular input. This is analogous to the C implementation of strings. Strings can be thought of as the input with ASCII constituting its input alphabet. The blank character here would be the `\\0` null terminator which signifies the end of the string. Note that the blank alphabet is **not** a part of this set.
    
3. $\Gamma$ - **The finite tape alphabet (includes blank)**
    
    $\Gamma$ is the finite _working_ alphabet + the _input_ alphabet. It is hence, a superset of the finite alphabet set $\Sigma$. The tape alphabet but contain at least _one_ more symbol than the input alphabet. Namely, the blank alphabet. However, apart from the blank alphabet, we can have many more _work_ alphabets which signify something of meaning to the TM read-write head. This is analogous to the "instruction encoding" of the ISAs used by modern computers.
    
4. $\delta:(Q\times \Gamma) \to(Q\times\Gamma\times\{L, R\})$ - **The transition function**
    
    When we are in some control state $Q$ and we read some tape symbol $\Gamma$, then we can move to some other state $Q'$, overwrite the contents of the current cell with some tape symbol $\Gamma'$ and move either to the left or to the right. Note that $\Gamma'$ and $Q'$ may be the same states. The transition function essentially just tells the Turing machine what to do when it reads some tape alphabet when it is in some control state $Q$.
    
    Note that it is also possible to remain in the same state. We can simply encode a move right and the right cell can be a move right. This would take 2 steps but the result is the same. The goal here is to define an abstract construct in a **simple** manner that allows us to represent any algorithm. _NOT_ defining the most efficient such construct.
    
5. $q_0$ - **The start state**
    
    Whenever the machine begins to work on a decision problem it must begin in some pre-defined control state. This is the _start_ state of the machine.
    
6. $q_{accept}$ - **The accept state**
    
    If the machine ever reaches this state, then the machine can decide that the input does indeed belong to the language and output `1` and stop.
    
7. $q_{reject}$ - **The reject state**
    
    If the machine ever reaches this state, then it can decide that the input does not belong to the language and output `0` and stop.
