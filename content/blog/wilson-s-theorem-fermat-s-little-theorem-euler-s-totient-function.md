Last time, we covered the [Extended Euclidean Algorithm](/blog/extended-euclidean-algorithm). Now, we'll delve into some cooler number theory. 
# Wilson's Theorem
Wilson's Theorem states that for any number $p$, the following congruence holds $\iff p$ is prime:
$$(p-1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$$
## Proof
### Proof for composite numbers
We can prove that this statement does not hold for any composite $p$ easily. Let $p$ be a composite number $\gt 2$. Then $p$ can be represented as the product of two numbers $a \cdot b = p$ for some $1 \leq a \leq b \lt p$. Note that this means that $a \mid (p-1)!$, hence $(p-1)! \equiv 0 \pmod{a}$. But if $a \mid p$ and $(p-1)! \equiv 0 \pmod{a}$, then $(p-1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$ cannot be true. $(p-1)! \pmod{p}$ must be 0. This is a contradiction. 
Therefore, if $p$ is composite, $(p-1)! \not \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$. Similarly, if the equivalence is -1, then $p$ cannot be composite. 
### Proof for prime numbers
Let's prove the case for $p = 2$ first. $(2-1)! = 1! \equiv -1 \pmod{2}$ is seen trivially. Now we will prove for all odd primes $p$. 
Note that in $Z_{p+} = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, p-1\}$, $\forall x \in Z_{p+}, \ \exists \ x' \mid x \cdot x' \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. This is essentially the existence of an inverse. Also note that the inverse must always be unique for each $x \in Z_{p+}$. Now, there are two possible cases, $x = x'$ or $x \neq x'$. 

Let's assume $x = x'$.  Then, 
$$
\begin{aligned}
x \cdot x' \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \\
x^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \\
\implies x \equiv \pm1 \pmod{p} \\ 
\implies x = 1 \ \lor \ x = p-1
\end{aligned}
$$
Therefore, the only two elements in this field with inverses equivalent to themselves are $1$ and $p-1$. Now, let's consider the entire product of $(p-1)!$. 
$$
\begin{aligned}
(p-1)! \pmod{p} \equiv (p-1)\cdot(p-2)\cdot(p-3)\cdots1 \pmod{p} \\
\text{Pairing off all the other elements with their unique inverses gives us} \\
(p-1)! \equiv 1\cdot (p-1) \pmod{p} \\
\implies (p-1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{p}
\end{aligned}
$$
Hence we have proved Wilson's theorem. 
# Fermat's Little Theorem

Fermat's little theorem states the following:

_If $p$ is a prime number, then for any integer $a$, the number $a^p -a$ is an integer multiple of $p$._

In other words,

$$ a^p\equiv a(mod \ p) $$

Further, if $a$ is not divisible by $p$, then

$$ a^{p-1} \equiv 1(mod \ p) $$

> Fun fact, this theorem is used to come up with a **very** accurate probabilistic [Randomization, Primality Testing Algorithms](/blog/randomization-primality-testing-algorithms)!
## Proof
The proof is as follows: Consider the set $Z_p = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, p-1\}$, which contains all the non-zero integers modulo $p$. Let's construct the following equation and work on rearranging / substituting terms. 
$$
\begin{aligned} 
(a \cdot 1)(a \cdot 2)(a \cdot 3) \cdots (a \cdot (p-1)) &\equiv a^{p-1} \cdot (1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdots (p-1)) \pmod{p} \\ &\equiv a^{p-1} \cdot (p-1)! \pmod{p} 
\end{aligned}$$ By Wilson's Theorem, we know that $(p-1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$ for any prime $p$. Substituting this, we get: $$a^{p-1} \cdot (p-1)! \equiv a^{p-1} \cdot (-1) \pmod{p}$$ Therefore, we have: $$a^{p-1} \cdot (-1) \equiv -a^{p-1} \pmod{p}$$ Rearranging the terms, we get: $$a^{p} - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$$ This can be rewritten as: $$a^{p} \equiv a \pmod{p}$$ Thus, we have proved Fermat's Little Theorem.
# Euler's Totient Function

Euler came along later and gave a more generalized version of Fermat's little theorem. He stated that for _any_ modulus $n$ and any integer $a$ co-prime to $n$, the following holds true.

$$ a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 (mod \ n) $$

Here, $\phi(n)$ is known as **Euler's Totient function.** It counts the number of integers between 1 and $n$ inclusive, which are co-prime to n. Or in simpler words, it is equivalent to the number of numbers less than $n$ that do not share any divisors with $n$.

**Some interesting properties:**

1. Notice that for any prime number $p$, $\phi (p) = p-1$. By virtue of being prime, $p$ does not share any factor with any number less than itself.
    
2. The totient function is a **multiplicative function**. This is not a trivial thing to see and follows from the Chinese remainder theorem. This [stack link](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/192452/whats-the-proof-that-the-euler-totient-function-is-multiplicative) has a really nice write up of the proof. This property essentially means that for relatively prime $a$ and $b$,
    
    $$ \phi (ab) = \phi(a)\cdot\phi(b) $$
    

Notice that Fermat's is indeed a special case of this theorem. When $n$ is prime, we get Fermat's little theorem.

Further, just like factorization, computing the value of $\phi(n)$ is a **hard** problem. However, notice that if the factorization of $n$ is known, we can compute the value easily. We can simply write $n$ in terms of its prime products and write $\phi(n) = \phi(p_1) \cdot \phi(p_2)\cdots \phi(p_n)$. And it is easy to compute $\phi(p)$ where $p$ is prime.
