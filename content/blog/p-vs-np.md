This is one of the most famous unsolved questions in computer science. I mean, seriously, the clay math institute offers a reward of a **million** dollars to the first person that is able to solve this problem. [https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/p-vs-np-problem](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/p-vs-np-problem)

Why? What's so special about this problem and what even _is_ the problem?

Let's begin by defining the problem. The problem asks, is $P = NP$? That is, is the set of _all_ the problems in $NP$ the same as the set of all the problems in $P$? A more intuitive way to phrase this question would be asking, "Are all problems that can be _verified_ in polynomial time, also be _solved_ in polynomial time?"

But why is this one of the most famous unsolved problems in computer science? What are the implications of such a result? Why is this even a question, do we even have _any_ reason to believe that $P$ _might_ equal $NP$?

Here are a few, _interesting_ answers to these questions.

1. If $P$ _did_ equal $NP$, it would mean that simply being able to _check_ if a solution is correct, would be **no harder** than solving the problem itself. Optimization problems like transport routing, production of goods, circuit design, etc. are **all** $NP$ problems. We would be able to get optimal answers to these solutions _much_ faster than we are able to today. The economy could be made so much more efficient. Protein folding is an $NP$ problem. If we could make protein folding a problem in $P$ then we would be able to make huge breakthroughs in biology. We would be able to cure cancer! One of my favorite quotes describing the implications of $P=NP$ is from an MIT researcher,
    
    > _"If P=NP, then the world would be a profoundly different place than we usually assume it to be. There would be no special value in “creative leaps,” no fundamental gap between solving a problem and recognizing the solution once it’s found. Everyone who could appreciate a symphony would be Mozart; everyone who could follow a step-by-step argument would be Gauss; everyone who could recognize a good investment strategy would be Warren Buffet."_ - Scott Aaronson
    
    One small downside is that RSA is also a $NP$ problem. If $P=NP$, all known security encryption measures would breakdown and none of our passwords would be safe :)
    
2. But the truth is, most computer science researchers do **not** believe that $P=NP$. Consider the first definition of $NP$ problems that we gave. We are essentially relying on non-determinism in our Turing machine. We are relying on the fact that the Turing machine is somehow able to "magically" or "luckily" _always_ pick the right path of traversal. Luck or magic is not something we can model in a deterministic Turing machine. However, despite all this, no one has been able to prove $P \neq NP$.
    
3. Finally, problems in $NP$ have indeed been shown to be in $P$. Consider sorting an array by going through all its different permutations, such an algorithm would take $O(n!n)$ time. It is not in $P$. However, after we cleverly came up with a better algorithm such as bubble sort or merge sort, we managed to reduce this problem to be in $P$ by coming up with an $O(nlogn)$ algorithm for solving it. Similarly, problems we once thought to be in $NP$ have been shown to be in $P$ after someone managed to come up with a clever algorithm to solve the problem faster. But just because some problems we thought to be in $NP$ were later found to be in $P$ , does not mean that the two classes are equal. In fact, that the question $P=NP$ ? is really asking is if $P = NP-Complete$. Recall that $NP-Complete$ problems are the hardest problems in $NP$. Every single problem that belongs in $NP$, including the $NP-Complete$ problems are reducible to an $NP-Complete$ problem. This means that if we could somehow reduce even **one** problem belonging to the $NP-Complete$ class to $P$, we would be able to prove $P=NP$. So far, problems in $NP$ were found to be reducible to $P$, but never an $NP-Complete$ problem. As mentioned on the Clay institute website, _"However, this apparent difficulty may only reflect the lack of ingenuity of your programmer."_ Someday, someone just might be able to come up with a radical new algorithm to reduce one of the $NP-Complete$ problems to $P$. There is a possibility, even if highly unlikely.
    

This is a view of the complexity classes as we know it, depending on the result of the $P$ vs $NP$ problem.
